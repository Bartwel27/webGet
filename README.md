# webget
Here's a paragraph explanation for your Python script tool:
This script is a file downloader that allows you to retrieve files from a specified URL with a given file extension. To use the script, simply provide the URL of the file you want to download, followed by the file extension (such as .pdf, .jpg, .zip, etc.). The script will then download the file from the provided URL with the specified extension. For example, if you enter a URL and specify the extension as .pdf, the script will download the PDF file from that URL. Note that you'll need to provide a valid URL and file extension for the script to work correctly. Once run, the script will save the downloaded file in the same directory where the script is located.
